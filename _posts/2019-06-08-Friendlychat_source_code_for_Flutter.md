# Friendlychat for Flutter

This is the source code for the Flutter FriendlyChat codelab. It includes the
offline and Firebase versions of the code. Codelab instructions will be
made available soon.

The offline version of Friendlychat requires only a recent copy of Flutter.
The Firebase version of Friendlychat requires that you register your Android app's
key, create an OAuth iOS client id, and download a google-services.json file.
See the [codelab](https://github.com/flutter/friendlychat-steps/files/2296209/OriginalFirebaseforFlutterCodelab.pdf) for more information.
