# Getting Started
Create this widget as you do with other widgets
```dart
Counter(
  initialValue: _defaultValue,
  minValue: 0,
  maxValue: 10,
  step: 0.5,
  decimalPlaces: 1,
  onChanged: (value) { // get the latest value from here
    setState(() {
      _defaultValue = value;
    });
  },
),
```

# Constructor Options
There are some required values and other are for the customization
``` dart
  @required num initialValue    // default value
  @required this.minValue       // minimum value
  @required this.maxValue       // maximum value
  @required this.onChanged      // callback
  @required this.decimalPlaces  // decimal places you want to show the value of
  this.color                    // color of the buttons
  this.textStyle                // text style which displays the value
  this.step = 1                 // step you want to set to change value
  this.buttonSize = 25          // if you want to change size of button
```

Beautify your widget with provided customization. You can also change color and size of both buttons and text.
Very simple to implement and looks awesome. You can find more details in sample app.
