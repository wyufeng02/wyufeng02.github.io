         quality: 85,//first compress quality, default 80
         step: 9,//compress quality step, The bigger the fast, Smaller is more accurate, default 6
         mode: CompressMode.LARGE2SMALL,//default AUTO
       );
    Luban.compressImage(compressObject).then((_path) {
        setState(() {

        });
